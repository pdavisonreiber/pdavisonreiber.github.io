I'm a mathematics and computer science teacher living and working in London. In my spare time I enjoy programming.

 Iâ€™ve have two apps on the App Store, [Grader+](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/grader/id1448038088), an app for teachers for counting up marks on tests, and [Kwicket](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/kwicket/id1619946182), an app for scoring cricket matches.
 
 I also offer online mathematics tuition. Get in touch if you are interested.
